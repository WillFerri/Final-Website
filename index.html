                You’ve found it. You may rest your
                weary head and open your tired ears, as you have officially stumbled upon the greatest college
                football podcast ever assembled. If you pride yourself on being interested in all thing’s college
                football – the brands, the mascots, the coaches, the drama, the playoff, the unrivaled environment
                – then this is undoubtedly the show for you. Come for expert, sometimes amateur, analysis, and
                stay for the banter, fun-loving coverage of our great sport, inventive and unique segments, and
                some mediocre (at best) comedy. The PodNameCFB is uploaded bi-weekly (Mondays and
                Thursdays during the season) and is your exclusive one stop shop for all the news and analysis
                you’ve been searching for. Forget the bland studio products that you must trudge your way through,
                forget the non-innovative hosts you’ve grown to tolerate, and forget the bias of sports media. Sit
                back and let us guide you through the wonderful world of college football.

                    The PodNameCFB was originally founded under the conditions of being ran by
                    a single host – William Ferri – in 2021 and carried a less than appropriate name. Though this original
                    template was carried for a few episodes, he was soon joined by 2 childhood friends to help realize
                    his passion project, Donovan Ventura, and Troy Thibodeau. After the 2021 college football season,
                    however, the show fell into a long-winded hiatus. Throughout the silence, the crew worked to create
                    something more professional and palatable to the general masses, which was finally brought to life
                    at the beginning of the 2023 season and hasn’t looked back since.
