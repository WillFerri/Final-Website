                    The guys are back to review the early bowl 
                    matchups that occurred over the weekend, Troy 
                    does not in fact know the mascot of middle 
                    tennessee state, and loads more fun topics
                    and banter.

                Is it filler? perhaps. The college football slate has once again disappeared and given way to an episode where
                we honestly didn’t know what to discuss, so we put the season in review. Check in for The Pod Name CFB Hosts 
                Award show, the 3 best coaching moves thus far, and a look back to the predictions we made at the beginning of the season.

                God bless our troops. The pod name cfb hosts are back to discuss the armed forces matchup that occurred 
                over the weekend, plus a whole lot more. The portal is on fire, national awards were released before the weekend, 
                full review included, and it’s high time for some crappy bowl matchups

                Well, the college football regular season slate has come and gone like it has every year. 
                One regular season game remaining, Americas game, but we needed something to talk about more than that. 
                This is a pretty odd episode, rankings of the 5 best games of the year, 5 bowl matchups each host is most excited 
                for, an immaculate grid..
